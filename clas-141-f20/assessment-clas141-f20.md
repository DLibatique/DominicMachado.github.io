## Commonplace Book
&nbsp;  
Throughout the course, you will keep a commonplace book. A [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book) is a type of journal that was popular in the early modern era in which individuals would make note of passages that they found interesting and reflect on them.

The commonplace book will determine the details of your overall grade for the course.

## Ancient Source Analysis
&nbsp;  
One of the key skills that I would like you to develop over the course of the semester is the ability read and analyze ancient sources closely. These skills will not only serve you as students of ancient history, but also as readers and consumers of texts more generally. This first project seeks to take you through this process in a detailed and rigorous manner.

The Ancient Source Analysis is designed to give you practice doing just that. You will read a series of sources about an ancient event and analyze the historicity of these sources, based on a series of criteria. For further specifics, go to the Ancient Source Analysis [page](https://dominicmachado.github.io/ancient-source-analysis-clas141-f20) on the site.

This project will be grading on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis, according to the rubric outlined on the site. In order to pass this class, you will need to earn a satisfactory grade on this assignment. As such you will be allowed to revise this project until you earn a satisfactory grade.
