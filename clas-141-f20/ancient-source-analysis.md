## Ancient Source Analysis

- Due: September 25, 2 PM (by email)
- Length: 1000 - 1500 words
- Format: Double-spaced, 12-point font

One of the key skills that I would like you to develop over the course of the semester is the ability read and analyze ancient sources closely. These skills will not only serve you as students of ancient history, but also as readers and consumers of texts more generally. This first project seeks to take you through this process in a detailed and rigorous manner.

You will read a number of [passages](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OL8DTs27ZWk3j3xCKSy7jaIhKAiec5dm/view) that historians have used to reconstruct an event often referred to as the Lelantine War. The event has attracted a lot of scholarly attention due to the nature of the sources involved.

Your analysis will be broken up into three parts. The first part of your analysis will include a bit of basic research about the sources. You will look up the different sources and their authors in the [Oxford Classical Dictionary](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OL8DTs27ZWk3j3xCKSy7jaIhKAiec5dm/view) and write up a brief two to three sentence summary of each source. Your summary should explain include the following pieces of information:

-	When the author lived
-	Where the author came from
-	The nature of the work cited (e.g. genre/purpose)

The second part of your analysis will attempt to establish some basic facts about the Lelantine War. You will answer the following question in the second part of your analysis:

- Can we establish definitely the participants in the war?
 -	Which sources explicitly speak about the war’s participants?
 - Does the answer to this question change over time?
 - Is there reason to think these sources that speak to it are accurate or inaccurate?

- Can we establish definitely the cause of the war?
 - Which sources explicitly speak about the war’s causes?
 - Does the answer to this question change over time?
 - Is there reason to think these sources that speak to it are accurate or inaccurate?

- Can we establish definitely the date of the war?
 - Which sources explicitly speak about the date of the war?
 - Does the answer to this question change over time?
 - Is there reason to think these sources that speak to it are accurate or inaccurate?

The third part of your analysis will synthesize your analysis from the first two parts of the project for the purpose of drawing conclusions about this particular set of documents and reflecting more broadly about the key features of primary source analysis more generally. To the end, you will address the following questions:
